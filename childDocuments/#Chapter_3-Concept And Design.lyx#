\begin_layout Chapter
Concept and Design of the System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part is about elaborating the application concept and design from the
 requirements deduced from the background of the thesis.
 Among the discussed matters, the market and the tool presented, it has
 been done a selection and a conception of the project leads in this thesis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking into consideration the survey, the main market actors and the tools
 available, it has been pointed out some requirements that it would be desirable
 to fulfill.

\begin_layout Subsection
The market demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first, let's focus on the the market related requirement.
 It includes survey pointing out, market missing offer and network relative
 choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No advertisement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first of the expectations of the software is to not have advertisement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Market growing need
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is discussed in the first part, ads have unwanted effects on watchers
 and we would like to prevent them from these effects as there is a a growing
 demand of not advertised content ( e.g.
 first part ) .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
A free service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
emerge on the market
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to provide a service free for the user.
 On the market of video hosting , most of the actors are free of costs.
 Our solution would not be attractive if we would ask users to pay.
 Some actors like Netflix are not free but they provide copyrighted series
 in an easy way that is not our target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to emerge on the market , we would need to be free as Youtube.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Not supporting the hosting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the problem is that providing a free service doesn't get along with the
 previous point.
 Indeed , Youtube finance the hosting cost of its service with the advertisement.
 We tried to conciliate both of the aspect in our project.
 That's means supporting not supporting the hosting cost of the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
quality service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it has been reported on the survey, one important aspect of a video hosting
 website is the speed delivery and quality of the video.
 In that sens we will try to optimize as its best the speed of delivering
 and the quality of the supplied videos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product should be easy to use.
 The user interface is most important thing in a such application.
 Most of the de
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A respectful service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously the application should be secure.
 It implies not possibility to track people or to be able to get personal
 data through it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Privacy respect 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike most of video hosting websites, the system should be able to make
 some statistics about video popularity without including personal data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other users of the network should not be able to know which video, other
 users used.
 Furthermore, the content downloaded should be safe for the users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
an Internet compatible service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the objectives of this project is to respect the mesh network philosophy.
 We would like to make prevailing a flat consumption of the internet.
 It means that it should propose a decentralization of the Internet as it
 has been made for at the origin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
a reliable service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
target fragile networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this project is also to give access to video hosting enjoyment
 to the poorly connected areas.
 In a lot of places in the world like India or Africa, the internet connection
 is not a certitude.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
failure resistant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like our software to be as much failure resistant as possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
scalability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software should also be prepared to absorb a big growth of users without
 crashing of slow the serving.
 It would a big advantage compared to a lot of online streaming website
 that deliver content very slowly on the critical hours.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User supported hosting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to be able to emerge on the market , it is necessary to opt for
 a free service for the users.
 A paid service would have too much difficulty to get known.
 However we should take into consideration the cost of hosting files.
 As we want a free service, we cannot invest in servers.
 We can't rely on money entries generated by advertisement either.
 The hosting of the service has to be powered mostly by the users.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Network management 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A way to ensure the speed of high definition videos and the best repartition
 of the videos among the network.
 We may use optimization algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Video player
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To display the content of the video, we need a video downloaded and a video
 player that would be able to play the video as it is not finished to load
 yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Quality content 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the market is already full of video players in streaming.
 They provide low quality video in order to has a good traffic.
 The application would reach a market niche if it could serve High Quality
 content.

\begin_layout Standard
To build the application , I will connect several tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Decentralized hosting, ad-free, high quality videos, reliable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main tool is used to build the application is the peer-to-peer protocol.
 It answer a lot problems I tried to solve.

\begin_layout Standard
It allow users to host the files they are viewing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a variety of softwares implementing it in any languages, usually
 free and open-source.
 most of the bittorrent client doesn't has any advertisement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is reliable : it is used by more than 10 years.
 We already know the problems it has, the drawbacks and the advantages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to provide torrent files has been discribed by its createor ( bittorrent.
com) and it consits in serving a website to host a the torrent files with
 a page of description for each file.
 Then you need to open the file with a client supporting the torrent protocol,
 wait for the download and finnally be able to play it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph

\begin_layout Standard
Using torrent technology make the system really more scalable.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Drawbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This way was convenient in the past but nowdays , with the actual bandwidth,
 we are used to get the content faster.
 A lot of serving file website arrived.
 Even if it is senseless due to the traffic it generate to a few nodes of
 the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, according to the survey and wathcing the market, people want to check
 videos and directly watch it.
 So, it needs an overlayer to improve the torrent protocol to get faster.

tool used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the needs of this project, I decided to use Tturns Bittorrent library
 ( source ) .
 It is a minimalist bittorrent client and software library that just do
 its job and not more.

Network management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to improve the download time due to the torrent procol.
 My idea was to increase the number of copies of a file if it doesn't have
 enough and ( maybe to decrease the number of copies.
 I chose to manage the distribution of the torrent files over the network.
 I would like to make more available the begining of each video file in
 order to improve availlability of this and by the same manneer , the speed
 of download.

\begin_layout Standard
Also , I needed a video player that would be able to play videos without
 the need of the video to be full.
 I found butter project that is a similar project but not focused on the
 network management.
 I based my development on this tool as a module in oreder to make a modular
 tool available to everything Torrent client.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Butter Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Butter Project or simply Butter is a suite of open source desktop and mobile
 applications that allow video-streaming over the BitTorrent protocol.[1]
 The project was first made public on the 23rd of October 2015.[2] The aim
 is to create a completely legal base which other applications can use to
 provide streaming functionality.[2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Butter Project was created as a split from Popcorn Time when the latter
 met legal difficulties — with Butter Project aiming to retain development
 of only expressly legal and permissible portions of the code-base, relating
 to video-streaming.
 The developers have asserted Butter Project will not use any of the popcorntime.
io infrastructure.[3] Butter Project is not aimed at allowing copyright infringem
ent, but aims to build the groundworks for streaming video over BitTorrent.[4]
 By having a legal portion which remains on GitHub the creators hope they
 can get more developers involved.[4]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default Butter can play content from VODO which carries free videos,
 but will also be configurable to allow for custom sources of video.[5]

The application need to be configured with the folder containing the torrents
 downloaded and the folder containing the downloaded files.
 The Client starts listing all the torrent files and compare them with the
 related downloaded files it finds.
 So that , it can figure out what are the hosted files and send the related
 torrents files to one of the JPaxos servers instances.
