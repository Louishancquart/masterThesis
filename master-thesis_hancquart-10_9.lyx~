Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The goal and the scope of the thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a continuum from the time where TV was set in the center of the living-room,
 people are watching more and Films and videos.
 it is set that the watching time per day didn't stop increasing from 20
 years (source) .
 And it is not about to stop.
 The next generation of video-eaters are even more hungry.
 They grown up with a smartphone and a lot of video applications available
 everywhere, all the time.
 The success of applications like hangouts, youtube, facebook ,vimeo...
 demonstrate an increasing usage and demand of videos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the video consumption is constantly increasing for years, the medium
 is changing.
 Traditionally, the TV is a top-down media type.
 There is an antenna owned by companies or governments channels that emits
 programs towards people watching.
 It is a one-to-many structure.
 On the Internet, the topology is totally different : born as Arpanet ,
 a university network to exchange research data, the Internet nature is
 to be flat.
 It is a one-to-one connection ( or peer to peer ).
 This medium, firstly reserved reserved to experts, has grown and got simpler
 to use, then spread to the majority of people.
 Nowadays almost everyone has an Internet connection.
 As a result, more and more people are switching off their TVs to browse
 through the Internet.
 Some content provider like Youtube or Dailymotin rose, reproducing the
 previous one-to-many pattern over the Internet.
 But as it makes no difference to increase the audience of a TV channel
 using an antenna, it is a bigger problem on a mesh network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By nature, Internet is a flat mesh network where each node can emit the
 content he likes.
 Transposing old technologies like TV on the Internet suppose to concentrate
 the majority of the data flux on a few nodes ( e.g.
 Youtube, Facebook, etc.) .
 Of course, watching videos on central websites like Youtube is by far a
 different experience than watching videos on TV.
 Many people can provide their content easily.
 It changes a lot of things : a lot more content providers, an infinite
 channels choice, an interaction between the provider and the audience.
 Nevertheless, on the most popular video platforms, all the content produce
 by the providers is the property of the host, e.g.
 the platform.
 The free access to the content provided is not a mandatory and may not
 remain as it is nowadays.
 The content control on some videos has already been observed and to support
 the service, providers sell advertisement space to their platform.
 In the future, the Internet video possibilities will look like its ancestor:
 the TV: central video supply , cut with advertisement and content controlled
 moreover in an environment meant to have a flat topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a problem that most of people doesn't get for the moment.
 Big companies already got the almost-monopoly of the video delivery on
 Internet.
 Simulating the Internet flat nature and freedom of speaking, they are loosing
 a lot of money storing freely a lot of videos from everyone.
 They are probably waiting to get more audience than the TV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, What can we do to avoid this? One solution is the peer to peer : Content
 hosted through by everyone for everyone.
 This technology is now available for more than a decade.
 At first it was the only way to exchange videos on the Internet.
 This network had too small data traffic capacities to allow video downloading
 from one website as we are doing right now.
 But recently this technology loose in popularity as it has begun too complex
 to use for the lambda user switching from TV to the Internet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of Thesis is to provide an efficient application to manage torrents
 automatically and to free the end user from downloading , latency , etc..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I will go through theses points: Background , ......
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Background 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin, I will set the background context, in order to give the key elements
 to understand the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first, I will draw your attention on the motivations under the thesis.
 Then we will speak about the Internet Economical environment.
 Finally, we will set the technical context on which this thesis started
 on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Thesis motivations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section is a description of the wills under the thesis.
 It is setting some reflections about the actual Internet and explains a
 few points that helped directing the work.
 It will go through the market Demand to show some expectations of the market,
 then it will go around the advertisement place on this market, to end explainin
g the importance of the internet neutrality, place on which is taking place
 this work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Existing Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where there is no need, there is no users.
 If there is no users , there is no market.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a survey research analysis trying to identify user habits and needs.
 The survey research was a part of the project realized in the frame of
 Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering classes at Poznan
 University of Technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectives is to get information about habits of people watching videos
 in order to help the production of a video platform software.
 The focus of the survey is targets user's habits to know how to fit their
 expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Design of the Survey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study was designed as successive independent sample.
 We decided to administer the survey to the participants in the following
 way : The questions were asked the same way to different people from random
 samples of a population.
 The answer should not differ with the time for a same person.
 It was released with a Google form ( e.g.
 appendix ).
 It is composed of 8 questions about video watching practices and it has
 been answered by 35 participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Survey questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To help the definition of development backlogs, the questions asked are
 about users habits, like what kind of videos, when are they watching videos,
 or on which device they are watching.
 Also about hits about expected quality of the system : questions about
 advertisement or loading time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
What device(s) are you using the most?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the devices used, the TV, cable and satellite are not used ( e.g.
 Appendix ).
 The computer is the most used device.
 A desktop application look like a good choice to develop the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobile is represented as well and its market is growing fast ( source
 ).
 It would be interesting to develop a web application or some technology
 easing the move to a browser application or a mobile application for future
 developments like Javascript or Java (native on Android).

\begin_layout Paragraph
When are you usually watching videos?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accroding to the results, a big part of the videos will be watched around
 during the same time.
 More than 85% are watching videos on the same period of the day (Evening,
 Night).
 Considering this, it is worth to focus on a technology able to take advantage
 of a it to decrease the data transfer.
 Thinking of a decentralized application, the memory of each user could
 be used to perform request of other users on the harddrive ( unicast )
 or to focus on the currently most watched videos ( broadcast / multicast
 ).
 Broadcast, multicast and unicast connections options should be explored
 and compared.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question showed that people are mostly focused on 3 kind of video :
 Music, Comedy and Documentary.
 It would be interesting to target on of those categories on the provided
 videos.

\begin_layout Standard
People obviously prefer the free and popular video platform like Youtube
 but the most popular platform just after it is the torrent platform.
 So the video platform can appear as an alternative available solution.
 Moreover, we can adapt front­end to not disturb users habits and couple
 a desktop application and a web front­end.

In general, people are able to bear a short delay if they use torrent (
 usually promise of good quality) or if the video is expected by the user.
 
\end_layout

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To put it in a nutshell, this survey was really interesting and useful.
 Combining results of the questions asked it is possible to orient the video
 platform development and get guide lines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the technical level, the choice of a desktop application is relevant
 compared to a website or a mobile application because the computer is by
 far the device used.
 Furthermore, it appear that the users are watching 2 hours per day on the
 same period of the day.
 A multicast strategy or duplication of the video content should be questioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the marketing level, the users mostly accept a delay for an expectedly
 interesting video.
 It is important to keep it in mind as on the beginning, the hosting costs
 might impede to have a big storage capacity.
 However, it is possible to compensate this by specailsing the video offer
 on one of the 3 most prefered kind of videos : Music, Comedy and Documentary.
 It could be interesting to as well to implement a ranking system in the
 application to provide interesting videos for the user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of ads to finance the platform should be limited at least at the
 beginning.
 It annoy the user and could decrease the watching time or completely make
 the system unattractive at all.

\begin_layout Standard
If the Internet seems to become the most used media, the advertisement still
 remains present in a lot of other media.

In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to emit it

 From now on, advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific

 The usage of tracking, customer profiling and the growing popularity of
 niche content gives a a number of more specific and smaller market target.
 However this advertisement is more segmented but much better defined ands
 so it's much more efficient.
 With an agreement with a specialist blog writer in a a specific domain,
 advertisers are able to communicate through famous specialists delivering
 interesting and specialized advices including marketed products to passionates.
 With this scenario, the message communicated by the brand, usually delivered
 in a top-down topology on television ( communication from the top of the
 head of the country communicator , like TV, to the mass) , is now certified
 as a good advice by a specialist of the area.
 The impact of the message would much more better on internet than with

Critique sur l'influence

La publicité télévisée est accusée de contribuer à l'augmentation de l'épidémie

 Un rapport remis en 2003 à l'agence des normes alimentaires au Royaume-Uni
 selon lequel la publicité pour la nourriture a un effet sur les enfants
 en influant sur la préférence de nourriture et sur les demandes d'achats
 pour des produits malsains60.
 Un groupe de scientifiques français responsables de questions de nutrition
 affirmait en 2008, dans une tribune intitulée « Engraisser les enfants
 pour sauver la télévision »61, et en se référant à des « rapports récents
 » : « Il existe même un lien entre une forte exposition aux publicités
 télévisées et l'obésité des enfants âgés de 2 à 11 ans ainsi que des adolescent
s de 12 à 18 ans.
 L'exposition à la publicité télévisée portant sur des aliments de haute
 densité énergétique (notamment sucrés et gras) est associée à une prévalence
 plus élevée de l'obésité.
 ».
 En 2010 l'organisation mondiale de la santé enfonçait le clou : « la publicité
 télévisée influe sur les préférences alimentaires des enfants et sur leurs
 demandes d’achat et leurs modes de consommation »62.
 À la même époque, en France, Que choisir remarquait que 80% des publicités
 destinées aux enfants l'était pour des aliments, et que 80% d'entre eux
 étaient trop gras ou trop sucrés63.

neuromarketing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neuromarketing is a field of marketing research that studies consumers'
 sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective response to marketing stimuli.
 Researchers use technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
 (fMRI) to measure changes in activity in parts of the brain, electroencephalogr
aphy (EEG) and Steady state topography (SST) to measure activity in specific
 regional spectra of the brain response, or sensors to measure changes in
 one's physiological state, also known as biometrics, including heart rate
 and respiratory rate, galvanic skin response to learn why consumers make
 the decisions they do, and which brain areas are responsible.
 Certain companies, particularly those with large-scale ambitions to predict
 consumer behaviour, have invested in their own laboratories, science personnel
 or partnerships with academia.[1] Present in over ten countries, the Neuromarket
ing Business Association[2] today centralizes academic publications and
 certifications and serves as a networking platform for professionals in
 the field.

Many consumers have reservations about online behavioral targeting.
 By tracking users' online activities, advertisers are able to understand
 consumers quite well.
 Advertisers often use technology, such as web bugs and respawning cookies,
 to maximizing their abilities to track consumers.[61]:60[97][98] According
 to a 2011 survey conducted by Harris Interactive, over half of Internet
 users had a negative impression of online behavioral advertising, and forty
 percent feared that their personally-identifiable information had been
 shared with advertisers without their consent.[99][100] Consumers can be

 Online ads are delivered by an ad server.
 Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on search

With the Internet came many new advertising opportunities.
 Popup, Flash, banner, Popunder, advergaming, and email advertisements (all
 of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace.
 Particularly since the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people
 may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend.[cit

 easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads
 to anyone willing to see or hear them.
 In the last three-quarters of 2009 mobile and internet advertising grew
 by 18% and 9% respectively.

Niche marketing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing
 importance of the niche market using niche or targeted ads.
 Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of The Long Tail, advertisers
 will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences.
 In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket
 the largest mass market audience possible.[citation needed] However, usage
 tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content
 brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide
 advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined,[citation

 for companies' marketing products.
 Among others, Comcast Spotlight is one such advertiser employing this method

 These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed

 A typical video commerce application would involve a video which contains
 a number of clickable objects so that the viewer can click on any of those
 objects for further information or to purchase them.
 However, the clickable object may not always be within the video itself,
 but part of the Flash or HTML5 player used to play back the video.

 conversion on eCommerce websites.
 The term was quickly adopted in the industry including the start of the

 ShopNBC was also the first home shopping network to utilize live (and archived)
 webcasts (web-only live video streams which sold products just like TV

Ad-blockers

\begin_layout Standard
It became difficult to browse the internet without being bombed with advertising
 pop ups, frames , etc.
 In order to prevent ourself from these enoyements, a set of addons and
 plugins emerged on each browsers to stop them : the adblockers ( or content
 filtering ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wiki: To users, the benefits of ad blocking include quicker loading and
 cleaner looking web pages free from advertisements, lower resource waste
 (bandwidth, CPU, memory, etc.), and privacy benefits gained through the
 exclusion of the tracking and profiling systems of ad delivery platforms.
 Blocking ads can also save substantial amounts of energy.[1][2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible for ad-blocking to benefit the natural environment via an
 indirect route.
 This arises because the advertising-and-marketing industry places a strong
 emphasis on building emotional connections with inanimate objects for sale,[3]
 [4] and on creating the urge to buy immediately.[5] [6] With the average
 person seeing more than 5000 advertisements every day, and with many of
 these being from online sources,[7] and with each ad promising viewers
 that their lives will be improved if they buy what is being promoted, [8]
 [9] [10] it is reasonable to expect that some people will end up buying
 items which they may not actually need.[11] If these items then end up being
 disposed of without actually being used, then the environmental impacts
 of waste disposal will inevitably arise.
 Because advertisements are very carefully crafted to target weaknesses
 in human psychology,[12] [3] it therefore follows that a reduction in advertise
ments viewed would result in less waste to dispose of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unwanted advertising can also harm the advertisers themselves if the users
 become irritated by the ads.
 Irritated users might make a conscious effort to avoid the goods and services
 of firms with annoying ads.[13]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For users not interested in making purchases, the blocking of ads can also
 save time.
 Any ad that appears on a website exerts a toll on the user's attention
 budget, since each ad enters the user's field of view and must either be
 consciously ignored or closed, or dealt with in some other way.
 A user who is strongly focused on reading solely the content that he/she
 is seeking likely has no desire to be diverted by advertisements that seek
 to sell unneeded or unwanted goods and services.[14] In contrast, users
 who are actively seeking items to purchase might appreciate advertising,
 in particular targeted ads.[15]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad-blocking can also save money for the user.
 If a user's personal time is worth one dollar per minute, and if unsolicited
 advertising adds an extra minute to the time that the user requires for
 reading the webpage (i.e.
 the user must manually identify the ads as ads, and then click to close
 them, or use other techniques to either deal with them, all of which tax
 the user's intellectual focus in some way),[16] then the user has effectively
 lost one dollar of time in order to deal with ads that might generate a
 few fractional pennies of display-ad revenue for the website owner.
 The problem of lost time can rapidly spiral out of control if malware accompani
es the ads.[17][18] This is discussed in more detail below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important aspect is improving security; online advertising subjects
 users to a higher risk of infecting their devices than surfing pornography
 sites.[19] In a high-profile case, malware was distributed through advertisement
s provided to YouTube by a malicious customer of Google's Doubleclick.[20][21]
 In August 2015, a 0-day exploit in the Firefox browser was discovered in
 an advertisement on a website.[22] When Forbes required users to disable
 ad blocking before viewing their website, those users were immediately
 served with pop-under malware.[23]

 connections) including most mobile users worldwide, have a direct financial
 benefit from filtering an ad before it is loaded.
 Streaming audio and video, even if they are not presented to the user interface
, can rapidly consume gigabytes of transfer especially on a faster 4G connection.
 Users without a data plan often pay by the megabyte, the cost of tolerating
 ads can be quite high.
 Even fixed connections are often subject to usage limits, especially the
 faster connections (100Mbit/s and up) which can quickly saturate a network
 if filled by streaming media.[citation needed]

Tim Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web was close to a P2P network
 in that it assumed each user of the web would be an active editor and contribut
or, creating and linking content to form an interlinked "web" of links.
 The early Internet was more open than present day, where two machines connected
 to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and
 other security measures.[4] This contrasts to the broadcasting-like structure
 of the web as it has developed over the years.[6] As a precursor to the
 Internet, ARPANET was a successful client-server network where "every participa
ting node could request and serve content." However, ARPANET was not self-organiz
ed, and it lacked the ability to "provide any means for context or content-based
 routing beyond 'simple' address-based routing."[7]

\begin_layout Standard
The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions
 tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called
 servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers
 communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client
 and server may reside in the same system.
 A server host runs one or more server programs which share their resources
 with clients.
 A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content
 or service function.
 Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await
 incoming requests.
 Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are
 Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

 We spend more and more time on Intertnet and video websites.
 Traffic on video hosting services are rising from a few years and it is
 slowly replacing the TV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a few reasons that makes these websites so popular.
 First, since internet has a flat topology, the communication is not top-down
 but more peer to peer.
 It gave a will of expressiveness.
 ( source to find ).
 Second of all, most people do not own web servers, and this has created
 demand for user-generated video content hosting.
 The hosting websites definitely answer this demand, providing a user-friendly
 interface and a common place to upload and watch videos.
 Further more, the video hosting websites are suiting the user expression
 will are they are adaped to low quality video like phone video, etc.
 It might change with the growing professionalism and quality video format
 of creators.

\begin_layout Standard
Users generally will upload via the hosting service's website, mobile or
 desktop applications or APIs.
 The type of video content uploaded can be anything from short video clips
 and digital audio files all the way to full-length TV shows and movies.
 The video host stores the video on its server offers individual different
 types of embed codes or links to allow others to view this video.
 The website, mainly used as the video hosting website, is usually called
 the video sharing website.
 Some video hosting services offer copyrighted TV shows, movies and music
 for which they have not obtained the necessary copyright approvals.

 the internet tends to have a flat topology , the media seems to not be
 so far from the TV than its topology suggest.
 Video hosting website are not a top- down communication system but it is
 not as flat as it is said to be ( source ).
 Everyone can express itself but the most viewed videos are made more suggested
 than the other ones.

 The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement,
 ceased operations and was finnally bought by Roxio then Rhapsody.
 The original service is now a music store, but the peer-to-peer concept
 gave birth to a lot of following companies and projects like : Gnutella,
 Freenet, Kazaa, Bearshare, LimeWire, Scour, Grokster, Madster, and eDonkey2000.
 some of them didn't stand until now mainly because of copyright issues.

\begin_layout Standard
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented
 to an end-user while being delivered by a provider.
 The verb "to stream" refers to the process of delivering media in this
 manner; the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than
 the medium itself, and is an alternative to file downloading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A client media player can begin to play the data (such as a movie) before
 the entire file has been transmitted.
 Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically
 to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either
 inherently streaming (e.g.
 radio, television) or inherently nonstreaming (e.g.
 books, video cassettes, audio CDs).
 For example, in the 1930s, elevator music was among the earliest popularly
 available streaming media; nowadays Internet television is a common form
 of streamed media.
 The term "streaming media" can apply to media other than video and audio
 such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which
 are all considered "streaming text".
 The term "streaming" was first used in the early 1990s as a better description
 for video on demand on IP networks; at the time such video was usually
 referred to as "store and forward video",[1] which was misleading nomenclature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of 2016, streaming is generally taken to refer to cases where a user
 watches digital video content and/or listens to digital audio content on
 a computer screen and speakers (ranging from a desktop computer to a smartphone
) over the Internet.
 With streaming content, the user does not have to download the entire digital
 video or digital audio file before she starts to watch/listen to it.
 There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet.
 If the user does not have enough bandwidth in her Internet connection,
 she may experience stops in the content and some users may not be able
 to stream certain content due to not having compatible computer or software
 systems.
 As of 2016, popular streaming website include YouTube, which contains video
 and audio files on a huge range of topics and Netflix, which streams movies
 and TV shows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Live streaming refers to Internet content delivered in real-time, as events
 happen, much as live television broadcasts its contents over the airwaves
 via a television signal.
 Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g.
 a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder
 to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network
 to distribute and deliver the content.
 Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although
 it frequently is.

History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early 1920s, George O.
 Squier was granted patents for a system for the transmission and distribution
 of signals over electrical lines[2] which was the technical basis for what
 later became Muzak, a technology streaming continuous music to commercial
 customers without the use of radio.
 Attempts to display media on computers date back to the earliest days of
 computing in the mid-20th century.
 However, little progress was made for several decades, primarily due to
 the high cost and limited capabilities of computer hardware.
 From the late 1980s through the 1990s, consumer-grade personal computers
 became powerful enough to display various media.
 The primary technical issues related to streaming were: having enough CPU
 power and bus bandwidth to support the required data rates and creating
 low-latency interrupt paths in the operating system to prevent buffer underrun
 and thus enable skip-free streaming of the content.
 However, computer networks were still limited in the mid-1990s, and audio
 and video media were usually delivered over non-streaming channels, such
 as by downloading a digital file from a remote server and then saving it
 to a local drive on the end user's computer or storing it as a digital
 file and playing it back from CD-ROMs.

\begin_layout Standard
Direct download link (DDL), alternatively simply direct download, is a term
 used within the Internet-based file sharing community.
 It is used to describe a hyperlink that points to a location within the
 Internet where the user can download a file.
 When used in conversation, DDL distinguishes itself from other forms of
 peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading architectures in that it uses a client–server
 architecture, where 100-percent of the file is stored on a single file
 server or in parallel across multiple file servers in a server farm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally, P2P was used to distribute large sized files without requiring
 much bandwidth on the part of any one node.
 However, because of sharing issues, such as the lack of seeding of torrents,
 throttling of a node's file sharing ports by an Internet service provider,
 or lawsuits because of uploading copyrighted material, direct downloads
 has become a popular and legal alternative among Leechers.
 There is also an increase in businesses offering gigabytes of free bandwidth
 and storage space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Video on demand (display) (VOD) are systems which allow users to select
 and watch/listen to video or audio content when they choose to, rather
 than having to watch at a specific broadcast time.
 IPTV technology is often used to bring video on demand to televisions and
 personal computers.[1]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Television VOD systems can either stream content through a set-top box,
 a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download
 it to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (also called
 a personal video recorder) or portable media player for viewing at any
 time.
 The majority of cable- and telco-based television providers offer both
 VOD streaming, including pay-per-view and free content, whereby a user
 buys or selects a movie or television program and it begins to play on
 the television set almost instantaneously, or downloading to a DVR rented
 from the provider, or downloaded onto a PC, for viewing in the future.
 Internet television, using the Internet, is an increasingly popular form
 of video on demand.
 VOD can also be accessed via desktop client applications such as iTunes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some airlines offer VOD as in-flight entertainment to passengers through
 individually controlled video screens embedded in seatbacks or armrests
 or offered via portable media players.
 Some video on demand services such as Netflix use a subscription model
 that requires users to pay a monthly fee to access a bundled set of content.
 Other services use an advertising-based model, where access is free for
 users, and the platforms rely on selling advertisements as a main revenue
 stream.

Developing VOD required extensive negotiations to identify a financial model
 that would serve both content creators and cable providers while providing
 desirable content for viewers.
 Key factors identified for determining the economic viability of the VOD
 model included VOD movie buy rates, Hollywood and cable operator revenue
 splits.[2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cable providers offered VOD as part of digital subscription packages, which
 by 2005, primarily allowed cable subscribers to only access an on-demand
 version of content that was already provided in linear distribution.
 Included in these packages were "extras" and "bonus footage" rather than
 full episodes of television shows.
 Functionality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Download and streaming video on demand systems provide the user with all
 of the features of Portable media players and DVD players.
 Some VOD systems that store and stream programs from hard disk drives use
 a memory buffer to allow the user to fast forward and rewind videos.

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to put video servers on local area networks, in which case
 they can provide very rapid response to users.
 Streaming video servers can also serve a wider community via a WAN, in

 History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From September 1994, a VOD service formed a major part of the Cambridge
 Digital Interactive Television Trial[3] in England.
 This provided video and data to 250 homes and a number of schools connected
 to the Cambridge Cable network (later part of NTL, now Virgin Media).
 The MPEG-1 encoded video was streamed over an ATM network from an ICL media
 server to set top boxes designed by Acorn Online Media.
 The trial commenced at a speed of 2 Mbit/s to the home, subsequently increased
 to 25 Mbit/s.[4] The content was provided by the BBC and Anglia Television.
 Although a technical success, difficulty in sourcing content was a major
 issue, and the project closed in 1996.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1998, Kingston Communications became the first UK company to launch a
 fully commercial VOD service and the first to integrate broadcast TV and
 Internet access through a single set-top box using IP delivery over ADSL.
 By 2001, Kingston Interactive TV had attracted 15,000 subscribers.
 After a number of trials, HomeChoice followed in 1999, but were restricted
 to London.
 After attracting 40,000 customers, they were bought by Tiscali in 2006
 who were in turn bought by Talk Talk in 2009.
 Cable TV providers Telewest and NTL (now Virgin Media) launched their VOD
 services in the United Kingdom in 2005, competing with the leading traditional
 pay TV distributor BSkyB.
 BSkyB responded by launching Sky by broadband, later renamed Sky Anytime
 on PC.
 The service went live on 2 January 2006.
 Sky Anytime on PC uses a legal peer-to-peer approach, based on Kontiki
 technology, to provide very high capacity multi-point downloads of the
 video content.
 Instead of the video content all being downloaded from Sky's servers, the
 content comes from multiple users of the system who have already downloaded
 the same content.
 Other UK TV broadcasters have implemented their own versions of the same
 technology, such as the BBC's iPlayer, which launched on 25 December 2007,
 and Channel 4's 4oD (4 On Demand) which launched in late 2006.
 Another example of online video publishers using legal peer-to-peer technology
 is based on Giraffic technology which was launched in early 2011 with large
 Online Video-on-Demand publishers such as US based VEOH and UK based Craze's
 OnlineMoviesBox movie rental service.
 The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 planned to launch a joint platform provisionally
 called Kangaroo in 2008.[5] This was abandoned in 2009 following complaints
 investigated by the Competition Commission.
 That same year, the assets of the defunct Kangaroo project were bought
 by Arqiva,[6] who used the technology behind Kangaroo to launch the SeeSaw
 service in February 2010.[7] A year later, however, SeeSaw was shut down
 from lack of funding.[8]

VOD services are now available in all parts of the United States, which
 has the highest global take-up rate of VOD.[9] In 2010, 80% of American
 Internet users had watched video online,[10] and 42% of mobile users who
 downloaded video preferred apps to a normal browser.[11] Streaming VOD systems
 are available on desktop and mobile platforms from cable providers (in
 tandem with cable modem technology) who use the large downstream bandwidth
 present on cable systems to deliver movies and television shows to end
 users, who can typically pause, fast-forward, and rewind VOD movies due
 to the low latency and random-access nature of cable technology.
 The large distribution of a single signal makes streaming VOD impractical
 for most satellite television systems.
 Both EchoStar/Dish Network and DirecTV offer video on demand programming
 to PVR-owning subscribers of their satellite TV service.
 Once the programs have been downloaded onto a user's PVR, he or she can
 watch, play, pause, and seek at their convenience.
 VOD is also quite common in more expensive hotels.
 VOD systems that store and provide a user interface for content downloaded
 directly from the Internet are widely available.[citation needed]

 A movie, for example, could be sent out once using a broadcast signal,
 rather than numerous times over cable or fiber-optic lines, and this would
 not involve the expense of adding many miles of lines.
 Sezmi planned to lease broadcast spectrum to offer a subscription service
 which National Association of Broadcasters president Gordon H.

Although video on demand generally refers to delivery mechanisms operating
 in accordance with applicable laws, the motivation for the development
 of video on demand services can be traced back to peer-to-peer networking

 These innovations proved that it was technically possible to offer the
 consumer potentially every film ever made, in a way which does not burden
 the original provider with the linear costs associated with centralised
 streaming media.

\begin_layout Standard
Near video on demand (NVOD) is a pay-per-view consumer video technique used
 by multi-channel broadcasters using high-bandwidth distribution mechanisms
 such as satellite and cable television.
 Multiple copies of a program are broadcast at short time intervals (typically
 10–20 minutes) providing convenience for viewers, who can watch the program
 without needing to tune in at a scheduled point in time.
 This form is bandwidth intensive and is generally provided only by large
 operators with a great deal of redundant capacity and has been reduced
 in popularity as video on demand is implemented; only the satellite services
 Dish Network and DirecTV continue to seriously provide NVOD experiences
 out of necessity as many of their customers have no access to their broadband
 VOD services.
 Before the rise of video on demand, pay-per-view provider In Demand facilitated
 this need by providing up to 40 channels in 2002, with several films receiving
 up to four channels on the staggered schedule to provide the NVOD experience.
 As of 2014, only four channels (2 in high definition, two in standard definitio
n) are provided to facilitate live and event coverage, along with existing
 league out-of-market sports coverage channels (varied by provider) by the
 service.
 In Australia, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel offers NVOD for new release movies.[22]
 Push video on demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Push video on demand is a technique used by a number of broadcasters on
 systems that lack connectivity to provide true video on demand or by broadcaste
rs who want to optimize their video streaming infrastructure by pre-loading
 the most popular contents to the consumer device.
 A push VOD system uses a personal video recorder (PVR) to store a selection
 of content, often transmitted in spare capacity overnight or all day long
 at low bandwidth.
 Users can watch the downloaded content at the time they desire, immediately
 and without any buffering issue.
 Push VOD depends on the viewer recording content, so choices can be limited.[23]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As content occupies space on the PVR hard drive, downloaded content is usually
 deleted after a week to make way for newer programs.
 The limited space on a PVR hard drive means that the selection of programs
 is usually restricted to most popular content.
 A new generation of Push VOD solution recently appeared on the market which,
 by using efficient error correction mechanisms, can free significant amount
 of bandwidth and that can deliver more than video e.g.
 magazines, interactive applications.

Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is a system through which television
 services are delivered using the Internet protocol suite over a packet-switched
 network such as a LAN or the Internet, instead of being delivered through
 traditional terrestrial, satellite signal, and cable television formats.
 Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the media in
 smaller batches, directly from the source.
 As a result, a client media player can begin playing the data (such as
 a movie) before the entire file has been transmitted.
 This is known as streaming media.

 In November 2006, it was bought by Google for US$1.65 billion.[4] YouTube
 now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.[5] The site allows users to
 upload, view, rate, share, and comment on videos, and it makes use of WebM,
 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety
 of user-generated and corporate media videos.
 Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, audio

 countries in Asia and Oceania.[8] Music can be browsed or searched by artist,
 album, genre, playlist, and record label.
 Spotify was launched in September 2008 by Swedish startup Spotify AB.
 As of June 2016, Spotify had more than 100 million active users[9] and
 about half a billion registered users.[citation needed] As of August 2016,
 Spotify had 39 million paying subscribers worldwide,[10] up from 30 million
 paying subscribers in March 2016.[11] Spotify Technology S.A.

As of August 2016, Spotify provides access to over 30 million songs, with
 more music being added approximately every day including albums, EPs, and
 singles.[14] Users can search for artists, albums, titles, labels and genres,
 and access songs from both major and independent labels.
 Some artists decided to opt out of Spotify.[7][15] Additionally, some artists
 withdrew from specific regions because of licensing restrictions.
 The desktop app allows music to be imported from iTunes,[16] while the
 main three apps (iOS, Android, and Desktop) allows downloading songs to
 listen to offline.[17] Users can download songs up to three devices with
 a song limit of 3,333 with a total track limit of 9,999 if the device song
 limit is reached on each device.[18][19] Users can create and share playlists,[2

\begin_layout Standard
Spotify, together with the music streaming industry in general, faces some
 criticism from artists claiming they are not being fairly compensated for
 their work as downloaded music sales decline and music streaming increases.
 Unlike physical or download sales, which pay a fixed price per song or
 album, Spotify pays artists based on their "market share" (the number of
 streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the
 service).
 They distribute approximately 70% to rights-holders, who will then pay
 artists based on their individual agreements.
 The variable, and some say inadequate, nature of this compensation,[25]
 has led to criticism.
 Spotify reports paying on average US$0.006 to US$0.008 per stream.
 In response, Spotify claims that they are benefiting the music business
 by migrating "them away from piracy and less monetised platforms and allowing
 them to generate far greater royalties than before" by encouraging users
 to use their paid service.[26][27]

 features.
 The original Popcorn Time team endorsed the popcorntime.io fork, and picked
 it as the successor to the official Popcorn Time as of August 2015.[7] In
 October 2015, the MPAA obtained a court injunction from Canada to stop

\begin_layout Standard
JPaxos is a Java library and runtime system for efficient state machine
 replication.
 With JPaxos it is very easy to make a user-provided service tolerant to
 machine crashes.
 Our system supports the crash- recovery model of failure and tolerates
 message loss and communication delays.
 State machine replication is a general method for implementing a fault-tolerant
 service by replicat- ing it on separate machines and coordinating client
 interactions with these replicas (or copies).
 The physical isolation of machines in a distributed system ensures that
 failures of server replicas are independent, as required.
 As long as there are enough of non-faulty replicas, the service is guaranteed
 to be provided.
 JPaxos makes the following assumptions about the replicated service: •
 deterministic behaviour, i.e.
 multiple copies of the service begun in the start state, receiving the
 same inputs in the same order will arrive at the same state having generated
 the same outputs • non-Byzantine failures, i.e.
 a service machine can only crash • crash-recovery supported, i.e.
 after crash, the service can be restarted with the same IP address.

\begin_layout Subsection
BitTorrent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact
 of distributing large files.
 Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent
 protocol allows users to join a "swarm" of hosts to upload to/download
 from each other simultaneously.
 The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror
 sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over
 networks with lower bandwidth.
 Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers,
 can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many
 recipients.
 This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in internet
 traffic in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in
 general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.
 A user who wants to upload a file first creates a small torrent descriptor
 file that they distribute by conventional means (web, email, etc.).
 They then make the file itself available through a BitTorrent node acting
 as a seed.
 Those with the torrent descriptor file can give it to their own BitTorrent
 nodes, which—acting as peers or leechers—download it by connecting to the
 seed and/or other peers (see diagram on the right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file being distributed is divided into segments called pieces.
 As each peer receives a new piece of the file it becomes a source (of that
 piece) for other peers, relieving the original seed from having to send
 that piece to every computer or user wishing a copy.
 With BitTorrent, the task of distributing the file is shared by those who
 want it; it is entirely possible for the seed to send only a single copy
 of the file itself and eventually distribute to an unlimited number of
 peers.
 Each piece is protected by a cryptographic hash contained in the torrent
 descriptor.[6] This ensures that any modification of the piece can be reliably
 detected, and thus prevents both accidental and malicious modifications
 of any of the pieces received at other nodes.
 If a node starts with an authentic copy of the torrent descriptor, it can
 verify the authenticity of the entire file it receives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially and are rearranged into
 the correct order by the BitTorrent Client, which monitors which pieces
 it needs, and which pieces it has and can upload to other peers.
 Pieces are of the same size throughout a single download (for example a
 10 MB file may be transmitted as ten 1 MB pieces or as forty 256 KB pieces).
 Due to the nature of this approach, the download of any file can be halted
 at any time and be resumed at a later date, without the loss of previously
 downloaded information, which in turn makes BitTorrent particularly useful
 in the transfer of larger files.
 This also enables the client to seek out readily available pieces and download
 them immediately, rather than halting the download and waiting for the
 next (and possibly unavailable) piece in line, which typically reduces
 the overall time of the download.
 Once a peer has downloaded a file completely, it becomes an additional
 seed.
 This eventual transition from peers to seeders determines the overall "health"
 of the file (as determined by the number of times a file is available in
 its complete form).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distributed nature of BitTorrent can lead to a flood-like spreading
 of a file throughout many peer computer nodes.
 As more peers join the swarm, the likelihood of a completely successful
 download by any particular node increases.
 Relative to traditional Internet distribution schemes, this permits a significa
nt reduction in the original distributor's hardware and bandwidth resource
 costs.
 Distributed downloading protocols in general provide redundancy against
 system problems, reduce dependence on the original distributor[9] and provide
 sources for the file which are generally transient and therefore harder
 to trace by those who would block distribution compared to the situation
 provided by limiting availability of the file to a fixed host machine (or
 even several).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One such example of BitTorrent being used to reduce the distribution cost
 of file transmission is in the BOINC Client-Server system.
 If a BOINC distributed computing application needs to be updated (or merely
 sent to a user) it can do so with little impact on the BOINC Server.[10]

Peer-to-peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media
 using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking technology.
 P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music,
 movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other
 connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content.[1] The
 nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution
 servers (not required).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Peer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design
 stages from the early networks like Napster, which popularized the technology,
 to the later models like the BitTorrent protocol.
 Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing
 games (e.g.
 the mmorpg Skyforge[2]) use it as their content distribution network for
 downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs
 for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Several factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation
 of peer-to-peer file sharing.
 These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization
 of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal
 computers.
 Users were able to transfer either one or more files from one computer
 to another across the Internet through various file transfer systems and
 other file-sharing networks.[1]

Streaming

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bandwidth and storage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unicast connections require multiple connections from the same streaming
 server even when it streams the same content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming standard
 definition video without experiencing buffering or skips, especially live
 video,[10] for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray
 Disc Player.
 5 Mbit/s is recommended for High Definition content and 9 Mbit/s for Ultra-High
 Definition content.[11] Streaming media storage size is calculated from
 the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula
 (for a single user and file) requires a storage size in megabytes which
 is equal to length (in seconds) × bit rate (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024).
 For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was
 a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 ×
 240 pixels window size) will be: (3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8×1024×1024)
 requires around 128 MB of storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the file is stored on a server for on-demand streaming and this stream
 is viewed by 1,000 people at the same time using a Unicast protocol, the
 requirement is 300 kbit/s × 1,000 = 300,000 kbit/s = 300 Mbit/s of bandwidth.
 This is equivalent to around 135 GB per hour.
 Using a multicast protocol the server sends out only a single stream that
 is common to all users.
 Therefore, such a stream would only use 300 kbit/s of serving bandwidth.
 See below for more information on these protocols.
 The calculation for live streaming is similar.
 Assuming that the seed at the encoder is 500 kbit/s and if the show lasts
 for 3 hours with 3,000 viewers, then the calculation is number of MBs transferr
ed = encoder speed (in bit/s) × number of seconds × number of viewers /
 (8*1024*1024).
 The results of this calculation are as follows: number of MBs transferred
 = 500 x 1024 (bit/s) × 3 × 3,600 ( = 3 hours) × 3,000 (number of viewers)
 / (8*1024*1024) = 1,977,539 MB

\begin_layout Standard
Popcorn Time is a multi-platform, free software BitTorrent client that includes
 an integrated media player.
 The applications provide a free alternative to subscription-based video
 streaming services (such as Netflix).
 Popcorn Time uses sequential downloading to stream video listed by several
 torrent websites (although other trackers can be added and used manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following its inception, Popcorn Time quickly received positive media attention,
 with some comparing the app to Netflix for being easy to use.[5] After this
 increase in popularity, the program was abruptly taken down by its original
 developers on March 14, 2014, due to pressure from the MPAA.[6] Since then,
 the program has been forked several times with several other development
 teams such as the Butter Project to maintain the program and produce new
 features.
 The original Popcorn Time team endorsed the popcorntime.io fork, and picked
 it as the successor to the official Popcorn Time as of August 2015.[7] In
 October 2015, the MPAA obtained a court injunction from Canada to stop
 the Canadian programmers of popcorntime.io,[8] and later obtained the domain
 name,[9] although the project reappeared on a new website popcorntime.sh.[10][11]

Security and trust
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peer-to-peer systems pose unique challenges from a computer security perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like any other form of software, P2P applications can contain vulnerabilities.
 What makes this particularly dangerous for P2P software, however, is that
 peer-to-peer applications act as servers as well as clients, meaning that
 they can be more vulnerable to remote exploits.[31] Routing attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, since each node plays a role in routing traffic through the network,
 malicious users can perform a variety of "routing attacks", or denial of
 service attacks.
 Examples of common routing attacks include "incorrect lookup routing" whereby
 malicious nodes deliberately forward requests incorrectly or return false
 results, "incorrect routing updates" where malicious nodes corrupt the
 routing tables of neighboring nodes by sending them false information,
 and "incorrect routing network partition" where when new nodes are joining
 they bootstrap via a malicious node, which places the new node in a partition
 of the network that is populated by other malicious nodes.[32] Corrupted
 data and malware See also: Data validation and Malware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prevalence of malware varies between different peer-to-peer protocols.
 Studies analyzing the spread of malware on P2P networks found, for example,
 that 63% of the answered download requests on the Limewire network contained
 some form of malware, whereas only 3% of the content on OpenFT contained
 malware.
 In both cases, the top three most common types of malware accounted for
 the large majority of cases (99% in Limewire, and 65% in OpenFT).
 Another study analyzing traffic on the Kazaa network found that 15% of
 the 500,000 file sample taken were infected by one or more of the 365 different
 computer viruses that were tested for.[33]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corrupted data can also be distributed on P2P networks by modifying files
 that are already being shared on the network.
 For example, on the FastTrack network, the RIAA managed to introduce faked
 chunks into downloads and downloaded files (mostly MP3 files).
 Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained
 malicious code.
 The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P2P networks
 in order to deter illegal file sharing.[34] Consequently, the P2P networks
 of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification
 mechanisms.
 Modern hashing, chunk verification and different encryption methods have
 made most networks resistant to almost any type of attack, even when major
 parts of the respective network have been replaced by faked or nonfunctional
 hosts.[35]

\begin_layout Standard
A Markov chain (discrete-time Markov chain or DTMC[1]), named after Andrey
 Markov, is a random process that undergoes transitions from one state to
 another on a state space.
 It must possess a property that is usually characterized as "memorylessness":
 the probability distribution of the next state depends only on the current
 state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
 This specific kind of "memorylessness" is called the Markov property.
 Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world
 processes.

Zipfs law

\begin_layout Standard
Zipf's law /ˈzɪf/ is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics
 that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical
 and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one
 of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions.
 The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950),
 who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he
 did not claim to have originated it.[1] The French stenographer Jean-Baptiste
 Estoup (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.[2][not
 verified in body] It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach[
3] (1856–1933).

\begin_layout Subsection
Pareto Principle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pareto principle (also known as the 80–20 rule, the law of the vital
 few, and the principle of factor sparsity)[1] states that, for many events,
 roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.[2] Management consultant
 Joseph M.
 Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo
 Pareto, who, while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, published his
 first paper "Cours d'économie politique." Essentially, Pareto showed that
 approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population;
 Pareto developed the principle by observing that 20% of the peapods in
 his garden contained 80% of the peas.[3]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a common rule of thumb in business; e.g., "80% of your sales come from
 20% of your clients." Mathematically, the 80–20 rule is roughly followed
 by a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a
 particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown
 empirically to exhibit such a distribution.[4]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to Pareto efficiency.
 Pareto developed both concepts in the context of the distribution of income
 and wealth among the population.

\begin_layout Standard
The way to provide torrent files has been discribed by its createor ( bittorrent.

 a page of description for each file.
 Then you need to open the file with a client supporting the torrent protocol,
 wait for the download and finnally be able to play it.

The client
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application need to be configured with the folder containing the torrents
 downloaded and the folder containing the downloaded files.
 The Client starts listing all the torrent files and compare them with the
 related downloaded files it finds.
 So that , it can figure out what are the hosted files and send the related
 torrents files to one of the JPaxos servers instances.

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the implementation part , I tried to maximize the user experience
 and the usability of the application.
 I will first speak about the architecture of the application : I tried
 to keep it as simple as possible.
 Then I will detail the code implementation to show how the application
 works.

Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The client class is the main of the application.
 Its function is to give periodical reports of the hosting content of the
 Client to the JPaxos server.
 It also has a composition with the bittorrentClient class that is in charge
 of downloading and sharing torrents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Process

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a presentation of the actual Client class.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The client start by the traditional main static method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
then it launches a thread method

Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This test class has been done to make sure there is no regression in the
 code and to facilitaite the development.
 The conception of the KaTorrentManager has been hazardous on its beginings
 as the concept of torrent file and downloaded ( torrent ) file are near
 and confusingly similar in the common language in spite of their purpose
 differ greatly.
 Moreover the concept of this class changed few time in order to make efficient
 statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This test has been created to unsure that the methods are fulfilling their
 duty the code.
