\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The goal and the scope of the thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a continuum from the time where TV was set in the center of the living-room,
 people are watching more and Films and videos.
 it is set that the watching time per day didn't stop increasing from 20
 years (source) .
 And it is not about to stop.
 The next generation of video-eaters are even more hungry.
 They grown up with a smartphone and a lot of video applications available
 everywhere, all the time.
 The success of applications like hangouts, youtube, facebook ,vimeo...
 demonstrate an increasing usage and demand of videos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the video consumption is constantly increasing for years, the medium
 is changing.
 Traditionally, the TV is a top-down media type.
 There is an antenna owned by companies or governments channels that emits
 programs towards people watching.
 It is a one-to-many structure.
 On the Internet, the topology is totally different : born as Arpanet ,
 a university network to exchange research data, the Internet nature is
 to be flat.
 It is a one-to-one connection ( or peer to peer ).
 This medium, firstly reserved reserved to experts, has grown and got simpler
 to use, then spread to the majority of people.
 Nowadays almost everyone has an Internet connection.
 As a result, more and more people are switching off their TVs to browse
 through the Internet.
 Some content provider like Youtube or Dailymotin rose, reproducing the
 previous one-to-many pattern over the Internet.
 But as it makes no difference to increase the audience of a TV channel
 using an antenna, it is a bigger problem on a mesh network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By nature, Internet is a flat mesh network where each node can emit the
 content he likes.
 Transposing old technologies like TV on the Internet suppose to concentrate
 the majority of the data flux on a few nodes ( e.g.
 Youtube, Facebook, etc.) .
 Of course, watching videos on central websites like Youtube is by far a
 different experience than watching videos on TV.
 Many people can provide their content easily.
 It changes a lot of things : a lot more content providers, an infinite
 channels choice, an interaction between the provider and the audience.
 Nevertheless, on the most popular video platforms, all the content produce
 by the providers is the property of the host, e.g.
 the platform.
 The free access to the content provided is not a mandatory and may not
 remain as it is nowadays.
 The content control on some videos has already been observed and to support
 the service, providers sell advertisement space to their platform.
 In the future, the Internet video possibilities will look like its ancestor:
 the TV: central video supply , cut with advertisement and content controlled
 moreover in an environment meant to have a flat topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a problem that most of people doesn't get for the moment.
 Big companies already got the almost-monopoly of the video delivery on
 Internet.
 Simulating the Internet flat nature and freedom of speaking, they are loosing
 a lot of money storing freely a lot of videos from everyone.
 They are probably waiting to get more audience than the TV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, What can we do to avoid this? One solution is the peer to peer : Content
 hosted through by everyone for everyone.
 This technology is now available for more than a decade.
 At first it was the only way to exchange videos on the Internet.
 This network had too small data traffic capacities to allow video downloading
 from one website as we are doing right now.
 But recently this technology loose in popularity as it has begun too complex
 to use for the lambda user switching from TV to the Internet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of Thesis is to provide an efficient application to manage torrents
 automatically and to free the end user from downloading , latency , etc..

\begin_layout Chapter
Backgrounds 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here will be presented the different backgrounds , contexts that is useful
 to understand this thesis work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part, I will tend to present the backgrounds involved in the realization
 of this thesis.
 First I will set the general context in which the thesis took place.
 Then I will speak about related works that I found interesting in the scope
 of my thesis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The general context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to set up the context of a decentralized video application, I would
 like to focus on 3 points : the network , the market, and the different
 actors to take into account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
An against nature Internet 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
History : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By nature, the Internet is a mesh network .
 Each points has an address to connect, exchange and publish information.
 This was the case in the beginning of Internet when the actors were professiona
l ones.
 However , today the situation isn't the same anymore.
 Youtube, a video sharing website, and Facebook, a social network website
 hosting videos, are respectively the 2nd and the 3rd most visited websites
 in the world.
 It means that the mesh network is turning into a convergent network.

 is a California-based company that provides commercial web traffic data
 and analytics.
 It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com.
 source wikipedia).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It isn't a porblem in itself.
 The actors of the Internet are acting according to the economy model we
 are living in.
 It could be a problem in terms of data traffic, data control , privacy
 control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A Recentralization of the network
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the historical Mainframe where all the data where stored and computed
 in a central place, the Internet nature is to be a mesh network : decentralized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is not a problem in itself, concentrate the world wide web in a few
 nodes is costly: hundreds of millions of connexions per second to one node
 doesn't come without a price.

\begin_layout Standard
In this part, I will try to explain how I will propose an answer to the
 problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The problem remembering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is constituted by the traffic dragged to a few hosting platforms
 like YouTube, Facebook and produce a clogging of the network.
 Although this one would be more efficient if the hosting of videos would
 be spread over the network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An other problem risen by the survey is about the speed of watching.
 the big advantage of big servers like YouTube lies in the fast delivery
 of videos.
 With a computing power at the level of the companies hosting these sites
 , with the means employed there the delivery can be fast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Concept

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of the application is to deliver a fast service freely with
 the less loading latency possible.
