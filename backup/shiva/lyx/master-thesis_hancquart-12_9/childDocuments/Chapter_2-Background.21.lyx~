\begin_layout Chapter
Background 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Chapter 2 provides the background context, in order to clarify the key
 elements to understand this project.
 This chapter contains three major parts, Thesis motivation, Economical
 context and Technical context.
 Getting through the first part of the chapter 2, it will be understood
 what are those factors that made the motivation of this thesis and then
 in next part, it will be shown how is internet economical environment and
 in the final part the technical context will be shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Thesis motivations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation of this project consist of three main factors: Existing Demand,Ad
vertisement and Data Decentralization.
 Each of them play important rules to illustrate the main will for done
 this thesis and why it is chosen.
 The following show the details regarding each factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Existing Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where there is no need, there is no users.
 If there is no users , there is no market.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a survey research analysis trying to identify user behavior.
 The survey research was a part of the project realized in the frame of
 Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering classes at Poznan
 University of Technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectives is to get information about habits of people watching videos
 in order to help the production of a video platform software.
 The focus of the survey is targets user's habits to know how to fit their
 expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Design of the Survey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study was designed as successive independent sample.
 It was decided to administer the survey to the participants in the following
 ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Same way of questioning to participants (different people from random samples
 of a population).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The answer should not differ with the time for a same person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Release with a Google form ( e.g.
 appendix ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
35 participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Survey questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it been told before, these questions were designed to illustrate the
 behavior (need,habit) of users in order to help the definition of development
 backlogs.
 The questions and related results are as up coming paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
What device(s) are you using the most?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the devices used, the TV, cable and satellite are not used ( e.g.
 Appendix ).
 The computer is the most used device.
 A desktop application look like a good choice to develop the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobile is represented as well and its market is growing fast ( source
 ).
 It would be interesting to develop a web application or some technology
 easing the move to a browser application or a mobile application for future
 developments like Javascript or Java (native on Android).

\begin_layout Paragraph
When are you usually watching videos?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the results, a big part of the videos will be watched around
 during the same time.
 More than 85% are watching videos on the same period of the day (Evening,
 Night).
 Considering this, it is worth to focus on a technology able to take advantage
 of a it to decrease the data transfer.
 Thinking of a decentralized application, the memory of each user could
 be used to perform request of other users on the hard-drive ( unicast )
 or to focus on the currently most watched videos ( broadcast / multicast
 ).
 Broadcast, multicast and unicast connections options should be explored
 and compared.

\begin_layout Standard
People obviously prefer the free and popular video platform like Youtube
 but the most popular platform just after it is the torrent platform.
 So the video platform can appear as an alternative available solution.
 Moreover, we can adapt front­end to not disturb users habits and couple
 a desktop application and a web front­end.

In general, people are able to bear a short delay if they use torrent (
 usually promise of good quality) or if the video is expected by the user.
 
\end_layout

It would be a good idea to favor the quality videos and expected ones, with
 a “like” system or with some ranking for a for example.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To put it in a nutshell, this survey was really interesting and useful.
 Combining results of the questions asked it is possible to orient the video
 platform development and get guide lines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the technical level, the choice of a desktop application is relevant
 compared to a website or a mobile application because the computer is by
 far the device used.
 Furthermore, it appear that the users are watching 2 hours per day on the
 same period of the day.
 A multicast strategy or duplication of the video content should be questioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the marketing level, the users mostly accept a delay for an expectedly
 interesting video.
 It is important to keep it in mind as on the beginning, the hosting costs
 might impede to have a big storage capacity.
 However, it is possible to compensate this by specializing the video offer
 on one of the 3 most preferred kind of videos : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Music, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Comedy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Documentary 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be interesting to as well to implement a ranking system in the
 application to provide interesting videos for the user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of ads to finance the platform should be limited at least at the
 beginning.
 It annoy the user and could decrease the watching time or completely make
 the system unattractive at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Advertisement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
history
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Latin, ad vertere : "to turn toward", the advertisement is a marketing
 communication to promote or sell something, usually a business's product
 or service.
 The purpose of advertisement can also to make sure that employees or shareholde
rs believe in the company.
 To be short, the advertisement is a way to convince a specific public to
 have a specific behavior

: buy a product, elect someone, incitement to reduce speed while driving,
 etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sponsors are usually companies that are looking to improve their brand
 image or their sells.
 It could also be governments in order to make citizen aware of something
 ( like ecology or safe driving) or political personalities to raise their
 popularity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
from television to the Internet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Internet seems to become the most used media, the advertisement still
 remains present in a lot of other media.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising
 or direct mail, are still widely used.
 But more and more people are using internet and the advertisement is getting
 into the new media as well as others before.

In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to emit it

 audiences.
 The usage of tracking, customer profiling and the growing popularity of
 niche content gives a a number of more specific and smaller market target.
 However this advertisement is more segmented but much better defined ands
 so it's much more efficient.
 With an agreement with a specialist blog writer in a a specific domain,
 advertisers are able to communicate through famous specialists delivering
 interesting and specialized advices including marketed products to passionates.
 With this scenario, the message communicated by the brand, usually delivered
 in a top-down topology on television ( communication from the top of the
 head of the country communicator , like TV, to the mass) , is now certified
 as a good advice by a specialist of the area.
 The impact of the message would much more better on internet than with
 television.

 Universities, of course supported by business and in co-operation with

 crafty methods to make advertising more effective.
 "NeuroMarketing is a controversial new field of marketing which uses medical
 technologies such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)—not to
 heal, but to sell products.
 Advertising and marketing firms have long used the insights and research
 methods of psychology in order to sell products, of course.
 But today these practices are reaching epidemic levels, and with a complicity
 on the part of the psychological profession that exceeds that of the past.
 The result is an enormous advertising and marketing onslaught that comprises,
 arguably, the largest single psychological project ever undertaken.
 Yet, this great undertaking remains largely ignored by the American Psychologic

 Un rapport remis en 2003 à l'agence des normes alimentaires au Royaume-Uni

 Un groupe de scientifiques français responsables de questions de nutrition
 affirmait en 2008, dans une tribune intitulée « Engraisser les enfants

 » : « Il existe même un lien entre une forte exposition aux publicités
 télévisées et l'obésité des enfants âgés de 2 à 11 ans ainsi que des adolescent
s de 12 à 18 ans.
 L'exposition à la publicité télévisée portant sur des aliments de haute
 densité énergétique (notamment sucrés et gras) est associée à une prévalence
 plus élevée de l'obésité.
 ».
 En 2010 l'organisation mondiale de la santé enfonçait le clou : « la publicité
 télévisée influe sur les préférences alimentaires des enfants et sur leurs
 demandes d’achat et leurs modes de consommation »62.
 À la même époque, en France, Que choisir remarquait que 80% des publicités
 destinées aux enfants l'était pour des aliments, et que 80% d'entre eux

 Increasingly, the emphasis in advertising has switched from providing 'factual'
 information to the symbolic connotations of commodities, since the crucial
 cultural premise of advertising is that the material object being sold
 is never in itself enough.
 Even those commodities providing for the most mundane necessities of daily
 life must be imbued with symbolic qualities and culturally endowed meanings
 via the 'magic system' of advertising.

 In this way and by altering the context in which advertisements appear,
 things 'can be made to mean 'just about anything' and the 'same' things
 can be endowed with different intended meanings for different individuals
 and groups of people, thereby offering mass produced visions of individualism."

Ad-blockers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It became hard to browse the internet without being bombed with advertising
 pop ups, frames , etc.
 In order to prevent ourself from these annoyance , a set of add-ons and
 plugins emerged on each browsers to stop them : the ad-blockers ( or content
 filtering ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wiki: To users, the benefits of ad blocking include quicker loading and
 cleaner looking web pages free from advertisements, lower resource waste
 (bandwidth, CPU, memory, etc.), and privacy benefits gained through the
 deprivation of the tracking and profiling systems of ad delivery platforms.
 Blocking ads can also save significant amounts of energy.[1][2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible for ad-blocking to benefit the natural environment via an
 indirect route.
 This arises because the advertising-and-marketing industry places a strong
 attention on building emotional connections with inanimate objects for
 sale,[3] [4] and on creating the urge to buy immediately.[5] [6] With the
 average person seeing more than 5000 advertisements every day, and with
 many of these being from online sources,[7] and with each ad promising
 viewers that their lives will be improved if they buy what is being promoted,
 [8] [9] [10] it is reasonable to expect that some people will end up buying
 items which they may not actually need.[11] If these items then end up being
 disposed of without actually being used, then the environmental impacts
 of waste disposal will inevitably arise.
 Because advertisements are very carefully crafted to target weaknesses
 in human psychology,[12] [3] it therefore follows that a reduction in advertise
ments viewed would result in less waste to dispose of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unwanted advertising can also harm the advertisers themselves if the users
 become irritated by the ads.
 In this case users might make a conscious effort to avoid services of firms
 with annoying ads.[13]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For users not interested in making purchases, the blocking of ads can also
 save time.
 A user who is strongly focused on reading solely the content that he/she
 is seeking likely has no desire to be diverted by advertisements that seek
 to sell unneeded or unwanted goods and services.[14]

Ad-blocking can also have some benefit like save money for the user.
 If a user's personal time is worth one dollar per minute, and if unsolicited
 advertising adds an extra minute to the time that the user requires for
 reading the webpage (i.e.
 the user must manually identify the ads as ads, and then click to close
 them, or use other techniques to either deal with them, all of which tax
 the user's intellectual focus in some way),[16] then the user has effectively
 lost one dollar of time in order to deal with ads that might generate a
 few fractional pennies of display-ad revenue for the website owner.
 The problem of lost time can rapidly spiral out of control if malware accompani
es the ads.[17][18] This is discussed in more detail below.

Another important aspect is improving security; online advertising subjects
 users to a higher risk of infecting their devices than surfing pornography
 sites.[19] In a high-profile case, malware was distributed through advertisement
s provided to YouTube by a malicious customer of Google's Doubleclick.[20][21]
 In August 2015, a 0-day exploit in the Firefox browser was discovered in
 an advertisement on a website.[22] When Forbes required users to disable
 ad blocking before viewing their website, those users were immediately
 served with pop-under malware.[23]

Users who pay for total transferred bandwidth including most mobile users
 worldwide, have a direct financial benefit from filtering an ad before
 it is loaded.
 Streaming audio and video, even if they are not presented to the user interface
, can rapidly consume gigabytes of transfer especially on a faster 4G connection.
 Users without a data plan often pay by the megabyte, the cost of tolerating
 ads can be quite high.
 Even fixed connections are often subject to usage limits, especially the
 faster connections (100Mbit/s and up) which can quickly saturate a network
 if filled by streaming media.

It is a known problem with most web browsers, including Firefox, that restoring

 The early Internet was more open than nowdays, where two machines connected
 to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and
 other security measures.[4] This contrasts to the broadcasting-like structure
 of the web as it has developed over the years.[6] As a precursor to the
 Internet, ARPANET was a successful client-server network where "every participa

All the most visited websites are based on client-server model.
 It is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads
 between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service
 requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers communicate over
 a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may
 locate in the same system.
 A server host runs one or more server programs which share their resources
 with clients.
 A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content
 or service function.
 Clients therefore estabilish communication sessions with servers which
 expect incoming requests.
 Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are
 Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

 The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement,
 ceased operations and was finally bought by Roxio then Rhapsody.
 The original service is now a music store, but the peer-to-peer concept
 gave birth to a lot of following companies and projects like : Gnutella,
 Freenet, Kazaa, Bearshare, LimeWire, Scour, Grokster, Madster, and eDonkey2000.
 some of them didn't stand until now mainly because of copyright issues.

A client media player can begin to play the data (such as a movie) before
 the entire file has been transmitted.
 Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically
 to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either
 inherently streaming (e.g.
 radio, television) or inherently non-streaming (e.g.
 books, video cassettes, audio CDs).
 For example, in the 1930s, elevator music was among the earliest popularly
 available streaming media; nowadays Internet television is a common form
 of streamed media.
 The term "streaming media" can apply to media other than video and audio
 such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which
 are all considered "streaming text".
 The term "streaming" was first used in the early 1990s as a better description
 for video on demand on IP networks; at the time such video was usually
 referred to as "store and forward video",[1] which was misleading nomenclature.

 video or digital audio file before she starts to watch/listen to it.
 There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet.
 If the user does not have enough bandwidth in her Internet connection,
 she may experience stops in the content and some users may not be able
 to stream certain content due to not having compatible computer or software
 systems.
 As of 2016, popular streaming website include YouTube, which contains video
 and audio files on a huge range of topics and Netflix, which streams movies
 and TV shows.

Live streaming refers to Internet content delivered in real-time, as events
 happen, much as live television broadcasts its contents over the airwaves
 via a television signal.
 Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g.
 a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder
 to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network
 to distribute and deliver the content.
 Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although
 it frequently is.

History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early 1920s, George O.
 Squier was granted patents for a system for the transmission and distribution
 of signals over electrical lines[2] which was the technical basis for what
 later became Muzak, a technology streaming continuous music to commercial
 customers without the use of radio.
 Attempts to display media on computers date back to the earliest days of
 computing in the mid-20th century.
 However, little progress was made for several decades, primarily due to
 the high cost and limited capabilities of computer hardware.
 From the late 1980s through the 1990s, consumer-grade personal computers
 became powerful enough to display various media.
 The primary technical issues related to streaming were: having enough CPU
 power and bus bandwidth to support the required data rates and creating
 low-latency interrupt paths in the operating system to prevent buffer underrun
 and thus enable skip-free streaming of the content.
 However, computer networks were still limited in the mid-1990s, and audio
 and video media were usually delivered over non-streaming channels, such
 as by downloading a digital file from a remote server and then saving it
 to a local drive on the end user's computer or storing it as a digital
 file and playing it back from CD-ROMs.

Direct download link (DDL), alternatively simply direct download, is a term
 used within the Internet-based file sharing community.
 It is used to describe a hyperlink that points to a location within the
 Internet where the user can download a file.
 When used in conversation, DDL distinguishes itself from other forms of
 peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading architectures in that it uses a client–server
 architecture, where 100-percent of the file is stored on a single file
 server or in parallel across multiple file servers in a server farm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally, P2P was used to distribute large sized files without requiring
 much bandwidth on the part of any one node.
 However, because of sharing issues, such as the lack of seeding of torrents,
 throttling of a node's file sharing ports by an Internet service provider,
 or lawsuits because of uploading copyrighted material, direct downloads
 has become a popular and legal alternative among Leechers.
 There is also an increase in businesses offering gigabytes of free bandwidth

Video on demand (display) (VOD) are systems which allow users to select
 and watch/listen to video or audio content when they choose to, rather
 than having to watch at a specific broadcast time.
 IPTV technology is often used to bring video on demand to televisions and
 personal computers.[1]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Television VOD systems can either stream content through a set-top box,
 a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download
 it to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (also called
 a personal video recorder) or portable media player for viewing at any
 time.
 The majority of cable- and telco-based television providers offer both
 VOD streaming, including pay-per-view and free content, whereby a user
 buys or selects a movie or television program and it begins to play on
 the television set almost instantaneously, or downloading to a DVR rented
 from the provider, or downloaded onto a PC, for viewing in the future.
 Internet television, using the Internet, is an increasingly popular form
 of video on demand.
 VOD can also be accessed via desktop client applications such as iTunes.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Developing VOD required extensive negotiations to identify a financial model
 that would serve both content creators and cable providers while providing
 desirable content for viewers.
 Key factors identified for determining the economic viability of the VOD
 model included VOD movie buy rates, Hollywood and cable operator revenue
 splits.[2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Cable providers offered VOD as part of digital subscription packages, which
 by 2005, primarily allowed cable subscribers to only access an on-demand
 version of content that was already provided in linear distribution.
 Included in these packages were "extras" and "bonus footage" rather than
 full episodes of television shows.

It is possible to put video servers on local area networks, in which case
 they can provide very rapid response to users.
 Streaming video servers can also serve a wider community via a WAN, in
 which case the responsiveness may be reduced.
 Download VOD services are practical to homes equipped with cable modems
 or DSL connections.
 Servers for traditional cable and telco VOD services are usually placed
 at the cable head-end serving a particular market as well as cable hubs
 in larger markets.
 In the telco world, they are placed in either the central office, or a
 newly created location called a Video Head-End Office (VHO).

From September 1994, a VOD service formed a major part of the Cambridge
 Digital Interactive Television Trial[3] in England.
 This provided video and data to 250 homes and a number of schools connected
 to the Cambridge Cable network (later part of NTL, now Virgin Media).
 The MPEG-1 encoded video was streamed over an ATM network from an ICL media
 server to set top boxes designed by Acorn Online Media.
 The trial commenced at a speed of 2 Mbit/s to the home, subsequently increased
 to 25 Mbit/s.[4] The content was provided by the BBC and Anglia Television.
 Although a technical success, difficulty in sourcing content was a major
 issue, and the project closed in 1996.

In 1998, Kingston Communications became the first UK company to launch a
 fully commercial VOD service and the first to integrate broadcast TV and
 Internet access through a single set-top box using IP delivery over ADSL.
 By 2001, Kingston Interactive TV had attracted 15,000 subscribers.
 After a number of trials, HomeChoice followed in 1999, but were restricted
 to London.
 After attracting 40,000 customers, they were bought by Tiscali in 2006
 who were in turn bought by Talk Talk in 2009.
 Cable TV providers Telewest and NTL (now Virgin Media) launched their VOD
 services in the United Kingdom in 2005, competing with the leading traditional
 pay TV distributor BSkyB.
 BSkyB responded by launching Sky by broadband, later renamed Sky Anytime
 on PC.
 The service went live on 2 January 2006.
 Sky Anytime on PC uses a legal peer-to-peer approach, based on Kontiki
 technology, to provide very high capacity multi-point downloads of the
 video content.
 Instead of the video content all being downloaded from Sky's servers, the
 content comes from multiple users of the system who have already downloaded
 the same content.
 Other UK TV broadcasters have implemented their own versions of the same
 technology, such as the BBC's iPlayer, which launched on 25 December 2007,
 and Channel 4's 4oD (4 On Demand) which launched in late 2006.
 Another example of online video publishers using legal peer-to-peer technology
 is based on Giraffic technology which was launched in early 2011 with large
 Online Video-on-Demand publishers such as US based VEOH and UK based Craze's
 OnlineMoviesBox movie rental service.
 The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 planned to launch a joint platform provisionally
 called Kangaroo in 2008.[5] This was abandoned in 2009 following complaints
 investigated by the Competition Commission.
 That same year, the assets of the defunct Kangaroo project were bought
 by Arqiva,[6] who used the technology behind Kangaroo to launch the SeeSaw
 service in February 2010.[7] A year later, however, SeeSaw was shut down
 from lack of funding.[8]

VOD services are now available in all parts of the United States, which
 has the highest global take-up rate of VOD.[9] In 2010, 80% of American
 Internet users had watched video online,[10] and 42% of mobile users who
 downloaded video preferred apps to a normal browser.[11] Streaming VOD systems
 are available on desktop and mobile platforms from cable providers (in
 tandem with cable modem technology) who use the large downstream bandwidth
 present on cable systems to deliver movies and television shows to end
 users, who can typically pause, fast-forward, and rewind VOD movies due
 to the low latency and random-access nature of cable technology.
 The large distribution of a single signal makes streaming VOD impractical
 for most satellite television systems.
 Both EchoStar/Dish Network and DirecTV offer video on demand programming
 to PVR-owning subscribers of their satellite TV service.
 Once the programs have been downloaded onto a user's PVR, he or she can
 watch, play, pause, and seek at their convenience.
 VOD is also quite common in more expensive hotels.
 VOD systems that store and provide a user interface for content downloaded

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Near video on demand (NVOD) is a pay-per-view consumer video technique used
 by multi-channel broadcasters using high-bandwidth distribution mechanisms
 such as satellite and cable television.
 Multiple copies of a program are broadcast at short time intervals (typically
 10–20 minutes) providing convenience for viewers, who can watch the program
 without needing to tune in at a scheduled point in time.
 This form is bandwidth intensive and is generally provided only by large
 operators with a great deal of redundant capacity and has been reduced
 in popularity as video on demand is implemented; only the satellite services
 Dish Network and DirecTV continue to seriously provide NVOD experiences
 out of necessity as many of their customers have no access to their broadband
 VOD services.
 Before the rise of video on demand, pay-per-view provider In Demand facilitated
 this need by providing up to 40 channels in 2002, with several films receiving
 up to four channels on the staggered schedule to provide the NVOD experience.
 As of 2014, only four channels (2 in high definition, two in standard definitio
n) are provided to facilitate live and event coverage, along with existing
 league out-of-market sports coverage channels (varied by provider) by the
 service.
 In Australia, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel offers NVOD for new release movies.[22]
 Push video on demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Push video on demand is a technique used by a number of broadcasters on
 systems that lack connectivity to provide true video on demand or by broadcaste
rs who want to optimize their video streaming infrastructure by pre-loading
 the most popular contents to the consumer device.
 A push VOD system uses a personal video recorder (PVR) to store a selection
 of content, often transmitted in spare capacity overnight or all day long
 at low bandwidth.
 Users can watch the downloaded content at the time they desire, immediately
 and without any buffering issue.
 Push VOD depends on the viewer recording content, so choices can be limited.[23]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As content occupies space on the PVR hard drive, downloaded content is usually
 deleted after a week to make way for newer programs.
 The limited space on a PVR hard drive means that the selection of programs
 is usually restricted to most popular content.
 A new generation of Push VOD solution recently appeared on the market which,
 by using efficient error correction mechanisms, can free significant amount
 of bandwidth and that can deliver more than video e.g.
 magazines, interactive applications.

Spotify, together with the music streaming industry in general, faces some
 criticism from artists claiming they are not being fairly compensated for

 Unlike physical or download sales, which pay a fixed price per song or
 album, Spotify pays artists based on their "market share" (the number of
 streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the
 service).
 They distribute approximately 70% to rights-holders, who will then pay
 artists based on their individual agreements.
 The variable, and some say inadequate, nature of this compensation,[25]
 has led to criticism.
 Spotify reports paying on average US$0.006 to US$0.008 per stream.
 In response, Spotify claims that they are benefiting the music business
 by migrating "them away from piracy and less monetised platforms and allowing
 them to generate far greater royalties than before" by encouraging users
 to use their paid service.[26][27]

JPaxos is a Java library and runtime system for efficient state machine
 replication.
 With JPaxos it is very easy to make a user-provided service tolerant to
 machine crashes.
 Our system supports the crash- recovery model of failure and tolerates
 message loss and communication delays.
 State machine replication is a general method for implementing a fault-tolerant
 service by replicat- ing it on separate machines and coordinating client
 interactions with these replicas (or copies).
 The physical isolation of machines in a distributed system ensures that
 failures of server replicas are independent, as required.
 As long as there are enough of non-faulty replicas, the service is guaranteed
 to be provided.
 JPaxos makes the following assumptions about the replicated service: •
 deterministic behaviour, i.e.
 multiple copies of the service begun in the start state, receiving the
 same inputs in the same order will arrive at the same state having generated
 the same outputs • non-Byzantine failures, i.e.
 a service machine can only crash • crash-recovery supported, i.e.
 after crash, the service can be restarted with the same IP address.

BitTorrent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact
 of distributing large files.
 Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent
 protocol allows users to join a "swarm" of hosts to upload to/download
 from each other simultaneously.
 The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror
 sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over
 networks with lower bandwidth.
 Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers,
 can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many
 recipients.
 This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in internet
 traffic in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in
 general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.
 A user who wants to upload a file first creates a small torrent descriptor
 file that they distribute by conventional means (web, email, etc.).
 They then make the file itself available through a BitTorrent node acting
 as a seed.
 Those with the torrent descriptor file can give it to their own BitTorrent
 nodes, which—acting as peers or leechers—download it by connecting to the
 seed and/or other peers (see diagram on the right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file being distributed is divided into segments called pieces.
 As each peer receives a new piece of the file it becomes a source (of that
 piece) for other peers, relieving the original seed from having to send
 that piece to every computer or user wishing a copy.
 With BitTorrent, the task of distributing the file is shared by those who
 want it; it is entirely possible for the seed to send only a single copy
 of the file itself and eventually distribute to an unlimited number of
 peers.
 Each piece is protected by a cryptographic hash contained in the torrent
 descriptor.[6] This ensures that any modification of the piece can be reliably
 detected, and thus prevents both accidental and malicious modifications
 of any of the pieces received at other nodes.
 If a node starts with an authentic copy of the torrent descriptor, it can
 verify the authenticity of the entire file it receives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially and are rearranged into
 the correct order by the BitTorrent Client, which monitors which pieces
 it needs, and which pieces it has and can upload to other peers.
 Pieces are of the same size throughout a single download (for example a
 10 MB file may be transmitted as ten 1 MB pieces or as forty 256 KB pieces).
 Due to the nature of this approach, the download of any file can be halted
 at any time and be resumed at a later date, without the loss of previously
 downloaded information, which in turn makes BitTorrent particularly useful
 in the transfer of larger files.
 This also enables the client to seek out readily available pieces and download
 them immediately, rather than halting the download and waiting for the
 next (and possibly unavailable) piece in line, which typically reduces
 the overall time of the download.
 Once a peer has downloaded a file completely, it becomes an additional
 seed.
 This eventual transition from peers to seeders determines the overall "health"
 of the file (as determined by the number of times a file is available in
 its complete form).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distributed nature of BitTorrent can lead to a flood-like spreading
 of a file throughout many peer computer nodes.
 As more peers join the swarm, the likelihood of a completely successful
 download by any particular node increases.
 Relative to traditional Internet distribution schemes, this permits a significa
nt reduction in the original distributor's hardware and bandwidth resource
 costs.
 Distributed downloading protocols in general provide redundancy against
 system problems, reduce dependence on the original distributor[9] and provide
 sources for the file which are generally transient and therefore harder
 to trace by those who would block distribution compared to the situation
 provided by limiting availability of the file to a fixed host machine (or
 even several).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One such example of BitTorrent being used to reduce the distribution cost
 of file transmission is in the BOINC Client-Server system.
 If a BOINC distributed computing application needs to be updated (or merely
 sent to a user) it can do so with little impact on the BOINC Server.[10]

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Peer-to-peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media
 using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking technology.
 P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music,
 movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other
 connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content.[1] The
 nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution
 servers (not required).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Peer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design
 stages from the early networks like Napster, which popularized the technology,
 to the later models like the BitTorrent protocol.
 Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing
 games (e.g.
 the mmorpg Skyforge[2]) use it as their content distribution network for
 downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs
 for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Several factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation
 of peer-to-peer file sharing.
 These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization
 of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal
 computers.
 Users were able to transfer either one or more files from one computer
 to another across the Internet through various file transfer systems and
 other file-sharing networks.[1]

Streaming

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bandwidth and storage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unicast connections require multiple connections from the same streaming
 server even when it streams the same content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming standard
 definition video without experiencing buffering or skips, especially live
 video,[10] for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray
 Disc Player.
 5 Mbit/s is recommended for High Definition content and 9 Mbit/s for Ultra-High
 Definition content.[11] Streaming media storage size is calculated from
 the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula
 (for a single user and file) requires a storage size in megabytes which
 is equal to length (in seconds) × bit rate (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024).
 For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was
 a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 ×
 240 pixels window size) will be: (3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8×1024×1024)
 requires around 128 MB of storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the file is stored on a server for on-demand streaming and this stream
 is viewed by 1,000 people at the same time using a Unicast protocol, the
 requirement is 300 kbit/s × 1,000 = 300,000 kbit/s = 300 Mbit/s of bandwidth.
 This is equivalent to around 135 GB per hour.
 Using a multicast protocol the server sends out only a single stream that
 is common to all users.
 Therefore, such a stream would only use 300 kbit/s of serving bandwidth.
 See below for more information on these protocols.
 The calculation for live streaming is similar.
 Assuming that the seed at the encoder is 500 kbit/s and if the show lasts
 for 3 hours with 3,000 viewers, then the calculation is number of MBs transferr
ed = encoder speed (in bit/s) × number of seconds × number of viewers /
 (8*1024*1024).
 The results of this calculation are as follows: number of MBs transferred
 = 500 x 1024 (bit/s) × 3 × 3,600 ( = 3 hours) × 3,000 (number of viewers)
 / (8*1024*1024) = 1,977,539 MB

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Popcorn Time is a multi-platform, free software BitTorrent client that includes
 an integrated media player.
 The applications provide a free alternative to subscription-based video
 streaming services (such as Netflix).
 Popcorn Time uses sequential downloading to stream video listed by several
 torrent websites (although other trackers can be added and used manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Following its inception, Popcorn Time quickly received positive media attention,
 with some comparing the app to Netflix for being easy to use.[5] After this
 increase in popularity, the program was abruptly taken down by its original
 developers on March 14, 2014, due to pressure from the MPAA.[6] Since then,
 the program has been forked several times with several other development
 teams such as the Butter Project to maintain the program and produce new
 features.
 The original Popcorn Time team endorsed the popcorntime.io fork, and picked
 it as the successor to the official Popcorn Time as of August 2015.[7] In
 October 2015, the MPAA obtained a court injunction from Canada to stop
 the Canadian programmers of popcorntime.io,[8] and later obtained the domain
 name,[9] although the project reappeared on a new website popcorntime.sh.[10][11]

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Peer-to-peer systems pose unique challenges from a computer security perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Like any other form of software, P2P applications can contain vulnerabilities.
 What makes this particularly dangerous for P2P software, however, is that
 peer-to-peer applications act as servers as well as clients, meaning that
 they can be more vulnerable to remote exploits.[31] Routing attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Also, since each node plays a role in routing traffic through the network,
 malicious users can perform a variety of "routing attacks", or denial of
 service attacks.
 Examples of common routing attacks include "incorrect lookup routing" whereby
 malicious nodes deliberately forward requests incorrectly or return false
 results, "incorrect routing updates" where malicious nodes corrupt the
 routing tables of neighboring nodes by sending them false information,
 and "incorrect routing network partition" where when new nodes are joining
 they bootstrap via a malicious node, which places the new node in a partition
 of the network that is populated by other malicious nodes.[32] Corrupted
 data and malware See also: Data validation and Malware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The prevalence of malware varies between different peer-to-peer protocols.
 Studies analyzing the spread of malware on P2P networks found, for example,
 that 63% of the answered download requests on the Limewire network contained
 some form of malware, whereas only 3% of the content on OpenFT contained
 malware.
 In both cases, the top three most common types of malware accounted for
 the large majority of cases (99% in Limewire, and 65% in OpenFT).
 Another study analyzing traffic on the Kazaa network found that 15% of
 the 500,000 file sample taken were infected by one or more of the 365 different
 computer viruses that were tested for.[33]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Corrupted data can also be distributed on P2P networks by modifying files
 that are already being shared on the network.
 For example, on the FastTrack network, the RIAA managed to introduce faked
 chunks into downloads and downloaded files (mostly MP3 files).
 Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained
 malicious code.
 The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P2P networks
 in order to deter illegal file sharing.[34] Consequently, the P2P networks
 of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification
 mechanisms.
 Modern hashing, chunk verification and different encryption methods have
 made most networks resistant to almost any type of attack, even when major
 parts of the respective network have been replaced by faked or nonfunctional
 hosts.[35]

 The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950),
 who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he
 did not claim to have originated it.[1] The French stenographer Jean-Baptiste
 Estoup (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.[2]
 It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach[3] (1856–1933).

Pareto Principle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pareto principle (also known as the 80–20 rule, the law of the vital
 few, and the principle of factor sparsity)[1] states that, for many events,
 roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.[2] Management consultant
 Joseph M.
 Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo
 Pareto, who, while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, published his
 first paper "Cours d'économie politique." Essentially, Pareto showed that
 approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population;
 Pareto developed the principle by observing that 20% of the peapods in
 his garden contained 80% of the peas.[3]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a common rule of thumb in business; e.g., "80% of your sales come from
 20% of your clients." Mathematically, the 80–20 rule is roughly followed
 by a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a
 particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown
 empirically to exhibit such a distribution.[4]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to Pareto efficiency.
 Pareto developed both concepts in the context of the distribution of income
 and wealth among the population.
